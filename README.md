Custom neural net
  - Randomized weights are generated in the constructor
  - Trained using backpropagation with the sigmoid activation function. 
      - This is where the errors are minimalized and the weight are revised over and over
      - Used mini-batches of size 100 which servers to reduce the effect of outlier and increase speed
